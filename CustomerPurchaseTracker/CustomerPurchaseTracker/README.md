# Project Overview - Code Journey Documentation

This project is structured to simulate a bookstore management system. Below is the basic structure of the project, including all required files and their purposes.

## Project File Structure

1. **Main.cpp** - The entry point of the program.
2. **Customer.h** - Header file for the `Customer` class, which manages customer data.
3. **Customer.cpp** - Implementation file for the `Customer` class.
4. **Purchase.h** - Header file for the `Purchase` class, which manages purchase-related information.
5. **Purchase.cpp** - Implementation file for the `Purchase` class.
6. **BookstoreManager.h** - Header file for the bookstore management system.
7. **BookstoreManager.cpp** - Implementation file for the bookstore management system.

## Implementation Details

### Customer.h

#### Header Guard
```cpp
#ifndef CUSTOMER_H
#define CUSTOMER_H
// ...
#endif

Prevents multiple inclusions of the header file.
A standard practice in C++ to ensure proper compilation.

Data Members (Private)

private:
    string firstName;
    string lastName;
    // Additional customer-related data members

Purpose:
Stores customer information securely.
Ensures encapsulation by keeping data members private.

Public Interface

public:
    // Constructors and destructor
    // Getter and setter methods
    // Operator overloads

Purpose:
Provides methods to interact with private data members.
Ensures proper access control and manipulation of customer data.
Best Practices:
Const correctness for getter methods to avoid unintended modifications.
